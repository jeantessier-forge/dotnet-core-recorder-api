# Todo App

This is a test app for building a web API in ASP.NET Core based on an OpenAPI
specification.

Loosely inspired by
[this API tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-code)
and [this OpenAPI article](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/16/using-openapi-with-net-core#writing_openapi_descriptions).

## To Run

```bash
dotnet run
```

The service will then run on [localhost:7086](https://localhost:7086/).
